# Css-challege-1
These challenges are here to help you flex your CSS skills, and see where you need to practise more!  If you're new to CSS,  You can clone my project and see.

#First Challenge:

This first challenge only involves changing your fonts and colours - no layout or other more advanced CSS here! Copy-n-paste the HTML to get started, and click on the image to see what your page should look like!

Hints:

You'll need to link your HTML to a new stylesheet.
You can use the following fonts list for help: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts
Don't worry if your text doesn't wrap at the same word -- it will depend on the size of your browser window.
